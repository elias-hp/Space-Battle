# Space Battle : A simple pygame experience 

## About:
I coded this simple little Pygame game for my "PROGRAMMING 1" course in high school.

#### OBS: This is a copy of a other repos files, commit-history was not copied because it contained copyrighted material. Im too lazy to combe trough the git-history w. the right command, so i copied the repos files instead.

#### OBS: This version does not contain the asset folder which the asset.py refers to. 

During the development of this game the copyright of assets used was not considered, therefore all assets are removed in this version.
Replacing these assets should be relatively simple as they are only really referred to by the asset.py file, but their pixel sizes might cause some trouble.

## Install:
#### Requirements are as follows:
* Python 3.9 or higher 
* All packages in requirements.txt

requirements.txt can easily be installed with the command:
> pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt

## Run:
To run the game it needs to be executed from it's working directory, inside the SpaceBattle folder.
When there, run the game with the following command:
> python3 ./main.py
